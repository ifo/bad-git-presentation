Talk on Git
===========

1. What is Version Control?
  - It controls versions
  - TODO: Actually tell them what it is

2. Why Git?
  - Git is Distributed
    - We're all about to use git, together.
    - Everyone will have their own copy of the entirety of the examples
    - We will merge any differences back together when we make changes
    - TODO: Talk about how the distributed model isn't perfect (but it totally is :P )


### Ideas to talk about (not yet ordered)

- The anatomy of a good git commit message
- git commit --amend
